Web-page to display Google IPv6 country data as a ranked list
=============================================================

This is the code repository that generates https://www.aelius.com/njh/google-ipv6/

It is a statically generated website built using [Ruby].



## Development

You may need to install a recent version of ruby of my computer before you can run the scripts.
I use [rbenv] to install and manage different versions of ruby

First make sure you have [Bundler] installed:

    $ gem install bundler

Then install all the dependencies:

    $ bundle install

To build a copy of the website on your local machine run:

    $ rake
